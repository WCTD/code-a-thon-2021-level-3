# Code-A-Thon Level III Course Source Code

This repository contains the demonstration source code for the [We Connect The Dots](https://www.we-connect-the-dots.org/) 2021 [Code-A-Thon](https://www.we-connect-the-dots.org/2021-codeathon) Level III course. 

During the training sessions held during the week of January 17th (2021) we'll use these files to demonstrate different aspects of [React](https://reactjs.org/) development to help students get started with React development for their Code-A-Thon projects.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains several web application projects we'll use during the training sessions:

- `static-page-v1` - A simple React app that renders a static web page. There's nothing Reacty about this app, it's just straight HTML content rendered using React.
- `static-page-v2` - This version of the static page app adds some simple React capabilities to help illustrate the value of React as a web development framework vs. straight HTML. 
- `tip-calc-static` - A simple Tip Calculator web app; this is a static web application built using straight HTML and JavaScript. It is one of the sample applications from [Learning Progressive Web Apps](https://learningpwa.com). 
- `tip-calc-react-v1` - This folder contains a straight conversion of the Tip Calculator app into React. It doesn't do anything to take advantage of any of the capabilities of React.
- `tip-calc-react-v2` - This version of the application enhances V1 to use the capabilities of React. It creates a true React version of the app.
- `navigation-sample` - A sample app that highlights how to implement multi-page navigation in React. 

## Required Stuff

This course assumes that you're an experienced web developer, and know how to build web applications using Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). We will not teach you any of those technologies during the course.

To work with React, and participate in the Level III training sessions, requires that you have access to a computer system capable of running the React developer tool chain. Participants will also collaborate with other Code-A-Thon participants to build (code) and publish a React web application, so you'll also need accounts for several online services. 

Before attending the course, review the requirements and tool installation instructions provided in the [Requiements Document](https://github.com/WCTD/code-a-thon-2021-level-3/blob/main/requirements.md). 

If you have questions or issues completing the prerequisites installation, Create an [issue](https://github.com/WCTD/code-a-thon-2021-level-3/issues) in this repository or attend one of the Office Hour sessions offered by the We Connect The Dots Code-A-Thon team.
