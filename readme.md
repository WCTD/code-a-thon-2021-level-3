During the training sessions held during the week of January 17th (2021) we'll use these files to demonstrate different aspects of [React](https://reactjs.org/) development to help students get started with React development for their Code-A-Thon projects.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains several web application projects we'll use during the training sessions:

- `static-page-v1` - A simple React app that renders a static web page. There's nothing reacty about this app, it's just straight HTML rendered through React.

- `tip-calc-react-v1` -  
- `tip-calc-react-v2` - 
- `tip-calc-static` - A simple Tip Calculator web app; this is a static web application built using straight HTML and JavaScript. It is one of the sample applications from [Learning Progressive Web Apps](https://learningpwa.com).
