# Requirements & Prerequisites

This course assumes that you're an experienced web developer, and know how to build web applications using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We will not teach you any of those technologies during the course.

To work with React, and participate in the Level III training sessions, requires that you have access to a computer system capable of running the React developer tool chain. You must have a full-blown computer system (laptop or desktop computer), not a Chromebook or equivalent. You could even use a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) if you wanted.

The development system you use must have enough available disk space to install of the required tools; unfortunately, I don't have enough information to provide you with an exact number, but you should probably select a system that has at least 5 GB of available (free) disk space.

Participants will also collaborate with other Code-A-Thon participants to build (code) and publish a React web application, so you'll also need accounts for several online services. 

The purpose of this document is to provide you with all of the details you need to begin the course with everything you need to be successful.

## Software Component Installation

1. The React developer toolchain uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to create, build (compile), and deploy React web applications.

	To install Node.js, [download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and launch the downloaded file to perform the installation. The Node.js team publishes two versions of Node, a *Long Term Support* (LTS) version and the latest and greatest version called *Current*. For our purposes, you should install the LTS version if possible; we won't make use of any of the Current features (that I know of).
2. Git 
3. (Optional) GitHub desktop
4. (Optional) Google Chrome browser (or equavalent)
5. (Optional) React extension for Chrome

## Online Accounts

GitHub account
Netlify account (use the GitHub account)

## Getting Help
