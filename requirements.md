# Requirements & Prerequisites

Since the purpose of this course is to teach you real world skills you'll need to be a professional web developer, you must have a full-blown computer system, not a Chromebook.

This course assumes that you're an experienced web developer, and know how to build web applications using Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). We will not teach you any of those technologies during the course.

To work with React, and participate in the Level III training sessions, requires that you have access to a computer system capable of running the React developer tool chain. Participants will also collaborate with other Code-A-Thon participants to build (code) and publish a React web application, so you'll also need accounts for several online services. 

## Software Components

Node

## Online Accounts
